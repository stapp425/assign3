Part 2 Page Fault Count: 3210

----------------------------------------------

CONTRIBUTIONS
I have done most of the structure of this project, but I have received a hint from Dr. Silvestro on how I should structure my functions for how the program retrieves a valid frame number.
Everything is done to the best of my ability, so I am confident that my implementation of a page table is almost correct.
Some considerations that I have for parts of my application is the managing the valid bit of pages; if my page fault count is not correct, it could be due to that portion.
Some challenges that I have encountered from implementing this application is my lack of knowledge in both the intricacies of a page table and the C programming language as a whole.
Before working on this project, I only had experience in creating an executable from only 2 files, but since this project required several .c and .h files, I needed to delve deeper of these inner machinations.
